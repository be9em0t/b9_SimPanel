NextStep:
- Ensure Client UI reflects the state of Flight Sim.
✓ This will mean adding logic to sync button Images with the state.

✓ Maybe set a second, faster simConnect.RequestDataOnSimObject() for the throttle 
- Maybe imitate detente by being able to drag only up to detente.
✓ Maybe Add a button to reread all values from the Sim (or just reconnect?)


==== Understanding Your Requirements: ====

I need to read and set some variables, namely
- lights
- autopilot
- flaps
- trim
- throttle

I'd like to proceed in steps, as I have pretty rudimentary knowledge of the more arcane C# techniques.

For that, I'd like to proceed in steps:
- build app running locally to MSFS, that connects to MSFS and returns info that connection is working.
- add a single checkbox indication the status of Taxi Lights
- make the checkbox turn off and on Taxi Lights
- improve UI with button to Connect/Disconnect from MSFS

Once this is completed we'll plan the next steps.
