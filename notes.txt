Simconnect2024 does not work reliably over network, so - proxy+client.

Proxy:
1.init 
	- Start/Stop proxy + symlink 
	- test mode displaying data from symlink (in a textbox?)
	- types of data and frequency
	- .ini file
	- different setups for different planes
2.on connect
	- Read symlink -> send to client 
	- Read client -> send to symlink 
3.on disconnect 

Client:
1.init 
	- Start/Stop proxy link 
	- .ini file
	- different setups for different planes
2.on connect
	- Read proxy -> update MSForm 
	- MSForm User input -> send to proxy 
3.on disconnect

Hereï¿½s how we can proceed:

Understanding Your Requirements:

I need to read and set some variables, namely
- lights
- autopilot
- flaps
- trim
- throttle

I'd like to have a visual interface, Forms seems like the easiest choice, but I'm open to suggestions.

I need the app to run from another computer on the same network.


Development Environment Setup:

I have VS2022, MSFS2024 SDK and .NET (4.7 and 9.xx)

Starting with SimConnect:

I'd like to proceed in steps, as I have pretty rudimentary knowledge of the more arcane C# techniques.

For that, I'd like to proceed in steps:
- build app running locally to MSFS, that connects to MSFS and returns info that connection is working.
- add a single checkbox indication the status of Taxi Lights
- make the checkbox turn off and on Taxi Lights
- improve UI with button to Connect/Disconnect from MSFS

Once this is completed we'll plan the next steps.
